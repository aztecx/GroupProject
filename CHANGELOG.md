# CHANGELOG
## Guiding Principles
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- `The latest version comes first!!!!!`
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
## Types of changes
- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features. 
- `Removed` for now removed features. 
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes. 
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
