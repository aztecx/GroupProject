/// BoundingBoxPainter is a CustomPainter used to draw bounding boxes and labels

/// Jewei built it such that it takes a list of detection maps, where each map contains normalized
/// coordinates (x, y, width, height) and a label. It converts these normalized
/// values to actual positions based on the current canvas size => draws the bounding boxes
/// along with a label background and text.
