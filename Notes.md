# CE903-Speak Sight

## Abstract
This project aims to develop, implement and evaluate deep learning methods for detecting and identifying objects from images and videos using publicly
available image datasets, such as the [Microsoft COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home), and to develop a mobile app as a blind guide using
voice. An image may contain several different objects, including signs and texts. Your task is to localise and recognise objects from images of many object
categories, and to describe what are in the image and other useful information by voice. Detailed description of such task and examples of images can be
found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge. You are allowed to use third party tools/libraries for implementing
conventional computer vision methods and deep learning methods, as long as you acknowledge the use of them appropriately in your code and project
report.
